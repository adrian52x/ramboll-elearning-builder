## Intro
# Title
Biodiversity and Ecosystems: Awareness Training for Infrastructure

Type: Ramboll Transport
Module length: 30-45 minutes

# Description
What you learn from the module?
This e-learning course helps you grasp how infrastructure projects affect biodiversity. You will learn about key factors at various project stages and how to best manage them to minimise harm and maximise benefits. Additionally, the course also explores nature-based solutions.

At the end of the e-learning course, you will receive a handbook in both PDF and PPTX formats to support sustainability initiatives both internally and externally.

Biodiversity and ecosystems within infrastructure

# Flip Cards block - Key terminology (Biodiversity and ecosystems) - Existing block
Card 1
Ecosystems
A ecosystem is a community or group of living organisms that live in and interact with each other and their surroundings in a specific area.

Card 2
Biodiversity
Biodiversity — short for biological diversity — is the variety of all living things and their interactions. Biodiversity changes over time as extinction occurs and new species evolve. Scientists often speak of three levels of diversity: Species, genetic, and ecosystem diversity.

Card 3
Blue & green infrastructure (BGI)
Blue and green infrastructure refers to using water bodies and urban parks, trees, and ditches deliberately to increase ecosystem services such as water retention, reduction of the temperature and air pollution to increase the recreational value and habitats for biodiversity within the city. It is heavily linked to nature-based solutions in its design and implementation.

# Interactive-Tabs (2 - each tab with image) - Positive and negative impacts through infrastructure
There are multiple potential co-benefits of achieving biodiversity and ecosystems through infrastructure.
To make wise design decisions, we need to understand project’s direct and indirect impacts from various angles. Impacts can be positive, neutral, or negative.

Direct impacts are immediate and tangible effects that result from an action or decision. They occur through the direct interaction of an activity with environmental, social, or economic components.
Indirect impacts on the environment are those that are not a direct result of the project, often occurring away from the project site or as a result of a complex impact pathway. These indirect impacts are also known as secondary or even tertiary impacts.

Below you can see some of the examples of positive and negative impacts, but also global facts.
